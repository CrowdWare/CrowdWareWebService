<h2 id="deamoring">DeAmoring</h2>
<h3 id="dearmoring-a-part-of-the-back">DeArmoring a Part of the Back</h3>
<p>DeArmoring a part of the back involves releasing physical and energetic tension stored in the fascia, muscles, and deeper tissues. This process requires mindfulness, gentleness, and effective communication to ensure safety and effectiveness.</p>
<h3 id="step-by-step-guide">Step-by-Step Guide</h3>
<h4 id="1-preparation">1. Preparation</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Environment</strong>: Choose a quiet, comfortable, and warm space where the person can relax. Use a massage table or soft mat.</li>
<li><strong>Communication</strong>: Explain the process, emphasizing that it might feel intense but is aimed at releasing tension and pain. Ensure ongoing consent.</li>
<li><strong>Positioning</strong>: Have the person lie on their stomach, with a cushion or rolled towel under their chest for support if needed.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-locating-the-tension-point">2. Locating the Tension Point</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use your hands to gently palpate the back, feeling for areas of tension, sensitivity, or hardness. Common spots include:</li>
<li><strong>Upper back</strong>: Between the shoulder blades.</li>
<li><strong>Lower back</strong>: Near the sacrum or lumbar region.</li>
<li><strong>Sides of the spine</strong>: Paraspinal muscles.</li>
<li>Ask the person to let you know when you’ve found a tender spot.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-applying-pressure">3. Applying Pressure</h4>
<ul>
<li>Place your thumb, fingers, or knuckle gently on the identified point.</li>
<li>Gradually apply firm pressure—not too hard at once. Let the person guide you on the intensity (they should feel pressure, but not unbearable pain).</li>
<li>For larger muscles (e.g., trapezius), you may use your elbow or forearm for broader pressure.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4-holding-the-pressure">4. Holding the Pressure</h4>
<ul>
<li>Maintain consistent pressure on the spot for <strong>1–3 minutes</strong> or longer.</li>
<li>Encourage the person to <strong>breathe deeply</strong>, directing their breath to the area of tension.</li>
<li>Observe subtle changes:</li>
<li>The muscle may start to soften.</li>
<li>The pain may reduce.</li>
<li>The person might feel warmth or tingling as energy releases.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="5-releasing-the-tension">5. Releasing the Tension</h4>
<ul>
<li>As the pain subsides, gently reduce the pressure instead of removing it abruptly.</li>
<li>Lightly stroke or massage the area in circular or sweeping motions to encourage energy flow and relaxation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="important-tips">Important Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pain Threshold</strong>: Always respect the person’s limits. Pain should be tolerable and never overwhelming.</li>
<li><strong>Mindfulness</strong>: Focus your attention on the connection between your pressure and the person’s release. Energy often follows intention.</li>
<li><strong>Hydration</strong>: After the session, suggest the person drink plenty of water to help flush out released toxins.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-to-expect">What to Expect</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>During</strong>: The person may feel discomfort, tingling, or even emotional release. Reassure them that this is normal.</li>
<li><strong>After</strong>: They might feel lighter, more flexible, or emotionally refreshed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dearmoring-the-yoni">DeArmoring the Yoni</h2>
<p>DeArmoring is a process that reawakens the tissue in a woman's Yoni. To support this process, the woman should first be prepared with a full-body massage. This massage helps build trust and encourages her Yoni to open up to the giver.</p>
<h3 id="the-technique-of-dearmoring">The Technique of DeArmoring</h3>
<p>The core technique of DeArmoring involves focusing gentle pressure on each point within the Yoni. The woman is asked to indicate the point where she feels the pressure. A helpful guide is using the analogy of a clock. For example, if pressure is applied to the G-spot (located at the top of the Yoni when the woman is lying on her back), she might say <strong>12 o’clock</strong>. If the pressure is near the anus, she might say <strong>6 o’clock</strong>.</p>
<p>Each point is gently explored and connected to the brain. If a point feels numb or less sensitive, the pressure is gradually increased until the sensation is perceived. Sometimes, this point may cause pain. In such cases, the pressure is maintained until the pain subsides. The woman is invited to breathe into the pain and focus on the sensation. After a few seconds or minutes, the pain often dissipates, and the touch can transform into a pleasurable sensation, if successful.</p>
<p>This process is repeated with several areas in the Yoni. After DeArmoring, it is advisable for the woman to abstain from sexual activity for a few days, particularly intense or 'hard' sex. Interestingly, after this experience, she may not even desire intense sex, as she will be able to perceive gentle and slow touches much more intensely. Trust me, I’ve made this mistake with my partner before, and we had to repeat the DeArmoring because we couldn’t restrain ourselves.</p>
<h3 id="yoni-mapping">Yoni Mapping</h3>
<p>This process is also known as Yoni Mapping, as specific points in the Yoni are reconnected or 'mapped' to the brain. Even scar tissue, such as from an episiotomy during childbirth, can be transformed into natural, receptive tissue through this method. Castor oil is often used for this purpose. However, it is essential to test for allergies before applying the oil to ensure the recipient is not sensitive to it.</p>
